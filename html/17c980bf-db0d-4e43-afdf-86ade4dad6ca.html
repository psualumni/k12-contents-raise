<h3>Cool Down (5 minutes)</h3>
<h4>Student Activity</h4>
<p>The activities you learned in a prior lesson taught you the properties of exponents. These same properties work with rational exponents.</p>
<p>Simplify each, and then check your answers:</p>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <li> \({(x^2)}^\frac13\) <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^\frac23\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="2">
  <li> \(x^\frac23\;\cdot\;x^\frac23\) <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^\frac43\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="3">
  <li> \({(x^{-3})}^\frac25\) <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^{-\frac65}\;=\;\frac1{x^{\displaystyle^\frac65}}\)
  </li>
</ol>
<ol class="os-raise-noindent" start="4">
  <li> \({(x^\frac13)}^{-1}\) <br>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(x^{-\frac13}\;=\;\frac1{x^{\displaystyle^\frac13}}\)
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Response to Student Thinking</h4>
<h5> Points to Emphasize</h5>
<p>If students struggle to interpret rational exponents, refer back to the properties of exponents in the prior lesson. Help students understand the properties are the same, but now we are applying them to fractional values as well as integers. Students may also need additional support working with operations with fractions. Remember, too, there is a set of Automaticity Cards that you may wish to use with students to help develop their fluency with perfect squares or recognizing doubles and halves. More information about the Automaticity Cards and developing fluency is located in the Course Design section of the Appendix on the Unit Sequence and Resources page.</p>
