      <h3>Warm Up (5 minutes)</h3>
      
        <p>Throughout this lesson, students will use a context that involves two variables&mdash;the number of games and the number of rides at an amusement park&mdash;and a budgetary constraint. This warm up prompts students to interpret and make sense of some equations in context, familiarizing them with the quantities and relationships. Later in the lesson, students will dig deeper into what the parameters and graphs of the equations reveal. </p>
      
      <h3>Launch</h3>
      
        <p>
          Arrange students into groups of 2. Decide if students should complete the activity on their own notebook paper or use the Desmos activity. 
          <ul>
            <li>The Desmos activity includes additional questions that ask students to create tables and verbal descriptions. </li>
            <li>These questions act as scaffolds in preparation for determining an equation of the given scenario and creating descriptions for the other equations.</li> 
          </ul>
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>Desmos activities are different from the graphing calculator application because they lead students through one or more interactive tasks. As students progress through the activity, teachers may use the Teacher Dashboard to monitor student responses and use them for whole group discussion. Activities may also be set to identify student responses that are correct or incorrect.&nbsp;</p>

     <p> Give students a couple of minutes of quiet work time to work on the questions and then another minute to share their responses with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.</p>

      <h4>Student Activity</h4>
      
        <p>Jada has $20 to spend on games and rides at a carnival.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Games cost $1 each.</li>
          <li>Rides are $2 each.</li>
        </ul>

<p>As an alternative to the Desmos activity, answer the following questions.</p> 

<ol class="os-raise-noindent">
  <p>
    <li>Which equation represents the relationship between the number of games, \(x\), and the number of rides, \(y\), Jada could do if she spends all $20?</li>
  <ol class="os-raise-noindent" type="a">
      <li>\(x + y = 20\)</li>
      <li>\(2x + y = 20\)</li>
      <li>\(x + 2y = 20\)</li>
  </ol>
    
    <strong>Answer:</strong> \(x + 2y = 20\)
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Explain what each of the other two equations could mean in this situation. </li>
    
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Your answer may vary, but here are some samples.<br>
    In this situation, the equation \(x + y = 20\) could mean:
      <ul>
        <li>Jada spends $20 on games and rides that cost $1 each.</li>
        <li>The combined number of games and rides that Jada enjoys is 20.</li>
      </ul>
    
    In this situation, the equation \(2x + y = 20\) could mean:
    <ul><li>Jada spends $20 on games and rides, where games cost $2 each and rides are $1 each.</li></ul>
  </p>
</ol>
