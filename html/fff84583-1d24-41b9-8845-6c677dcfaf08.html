<h4>Activity (15 minutes)</h4>
<p>Up to this point in the unit, students have written and interpreted equations representing exponential change that
  were meaningful for non-negative input values. In this lesson, they interpret the meaning of a negative value in a
  context. The independent variable is time, \(t\), so negative values of \(t\) refer to times before
  \(t\) is 0.</p>
<p>For the last question, to find the time when the coral had the given volume, students may:</p>
<ul>
<li> Calculate the values of \(y\) when \(t\) is –3, –4, –5, etc. (i.e., extend the table
    of values, if they previously created one) until they reach 37.5 or a value close to it. </li>
<li> Repeatedly divide by 2 (or multiply by \(\frac12\)) the value of \(y\) when \(t\) is –2 until it
    approaches or hits 37.5. </li>
<li> Use the equation \(1,200\cdot 2^t=37.5\) to find the value of \(2^t\) and then reason about \(t\) from
    there. </li>
</ul>
<p>Look for students using these or other strategies so they can share later.</p>
<p>Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically.</p>
<h4>Launch</h4>
<p>Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage them to think quietly about the questions before discussing with their
  partner. Creating a table or spreadsheet may help students organize the work in the second question. If needed,
  encourage students to do so.</p>

</ol>
<h4>Anticipated Misconceptions</h4>
<p>Students may struggle to think of how to start finding the values for \(a\) and \(b\). Suggest that they make a
  table of corresponding values of \(t\) and \(y\), and think about starting with \(t\) and calculating \(y\).</p>
<p>They may also struggle with understanding a negative value for \(t\) referring to years. Emphasize that a value of
  \(t = -1\) represents the time 1 year before the estimate was made. Ask what a value of \(t = -4\) represents.</p>
<h4>Activity Synthesis</h4>
<p>Review how students found an equation, \(y=1,200\cdot 2^t\), to represent the volume of coral. Make sure that they
  recall that the 1,200 represents the 1,200 cubic centimeters of coral when it was first measured, and the 2 indicates
  the doubling of its volume each year.</p>
<p>Select students to share their interpretations of negative values of \(t\) and how they found the value of \(t\)
  when given a volume. Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“In this situation, what does it mean to say that when \(t\) is –3, \(y\) is \(1,200\cdot
    2^{-3}\) or 150?” (3 years before the coral was measured to be 1,200 cubic centimeters, its volume was 150
    cubic centimeters.)</li>
<li>“How did you estimate or find \(t\) when the volume of the coral was 37.5 cubic centimeters?”</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be helpful to display a graph of \(y=1,200\cdot 2^t\), such as the one embedded in the digital version of
  these materials. Display the graph (either with or without the points from the table plotted) and ask students to
  identify the volume of coral when \(t\) is –3 and the time when the volume of coral is 37.5 cubic
  centimeters.</p>
<p>If using the digital applet, consider initially turning off the function and the point, and hiding the expression
  list. Ask students to gesture at points on the graph corresponding to questions in the activity. Then, turn on the
  function and the point for demonstration. Remember that if you click on a plotted point, its coordinates are revealed.

<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>For parts “a” and “b” in the table, determine the value for \(y\) when \(d = -2\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Substitute the given domain value into the expression.</p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-2}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Rewrite any negative exponent as a reciprocal. </p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-2}\) \(= 4800 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^2 = 4800 \cdot \frac14\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Multiply to find \(y\).</p>
<p>\(y = 1200\)</p>
<br>
<h5>Example 2</h5>
<p>For parts “c” and “d” in the table, determine the value for\(y\) when \(d = -3\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Substitute the given domain value into the expression.</p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-3}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Rewrite any negative exponent as a reciprocal. </p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-3}\) \(= 4800 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^3 = 4800 \cdot \frac18\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Multiply to find \(y\).</p>
<p>\(y = 600\)</p>
<br>
<h5>Example 3</h5>
<p>For parts “e” and “f” in the table, determine the value for \(y\) when \(d = -5\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Substitute the given domain value into the expression.</p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-5}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Rewrite any negative exponent as a reciprocal. </p>
<p>\(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-5}\)\(= 4800 \cdot (\frac{1}{2})^5 = 4800 \cdot \frac{1}{32}\)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Multiply to find \(y\).</p>
<p>\(y = 150\)</p>
<br>
<h5>Example 4</h5>
<p>What does the value of \(y\) tell you about the area burned in the fire when \(d = -1\)?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>The \(y\) value at \(d= -1\) represents the fact that 2,400 acres had burned 1 day before the first measurement was
    taken. </p>
 <br>   
<h5>Example 5</h5>
<p>How much area had the fire burned a week before it measured 4,800 acres? Explain your reasoning. </p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Since there are 7 days in a week, to find the area burned a week before the fire was measured, we need to determine
    the value of \(y\) when \(d = -7\). </p>
<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Substitute the given domain value into the expression.</p>
<p> \(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-7}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 2 </strong> - Rewrite any negative exponent as a reciprocal. </p>
<p> \(y = 4800 \cdot 2^{-7}\) \(= 4800 \cdot \frac12 ^7 = 4800 \cdot \frac{1}{128}\) </p>
<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Multiply to find \(y\).</p>
<p> \(y = 37.5\) </p>
<p> \(37.5\) acres had burned a week before the fire measured \(4,800\) acres. The value is found by substituting
    \(-7\) for d since that represents \(7\) days before the first measurement of \(4,800\) acres. </p>
