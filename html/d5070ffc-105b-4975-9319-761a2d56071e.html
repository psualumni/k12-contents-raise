<p>Welcome to your <em>Algebra 1</em> module! We're genuinely excited for you to join our community and embark on a transformative learning journey!</p>
<p>This user-friendly guide is your roadmap to navigating the features and resources of our unique Algebra I content. Let's raise the bar on your algebra skills—get started with confidence today!</p>

<h3>I. Where to Start</h3>

<p><em>Algebra 1</em> has nine units, each of which begins with a special lesson called Overview and Readiness. These lessons provide a miniature review of the knowledge you need for the unit ahead. Completing these lessons will help you feel confident in your ability to handle what comes next. </p>
<p>Units 4 and 6 also have inquiry projects, meant to revisit previous knowledge while introducing you to upcoming topics. We recommend completing these alongside their respective Overview and Readiness lessons.</p>

A red box surrounds the unit number and a section titled Overview and Readiness to indicate where the Overview and Readiness prerequisite material is located. A blue box labeled “lessons” surrounds all the numbered and titled lessons in the unit. The next box is a yellow box labeled “project” and surrounds its location in the unit. The last part of the unit is surrounded by a green box and labeled “Wrap Up.”">

    After completing the <strong>Overview and Readiness</strong> lesson, you can progress through the regular <strong>Lessons</strong>. 
    Each Lesson has multiple pages to guide you through learning new skills and reinforcing old ones. 
    At the end of each unit, you will also find a <strong>Project</strong> and <strong>Wrap Up</strong> lesson covering the topics in the unit. Use these lessons to cement understanding of the skills you just learned.

The Primary learning activities are shown as the next two activities of the lesson and contain a self check and additional resources page. These are labeled with orange arrows and labeled Primary activities. The next part of the lesson is the Cool down and identified with a teal colored arrow and label. The last section of the lesson that is identified is the Practice using a red arrow and label. The Lesson Summary is also listed but it is not color coded as part of the breakdown.">

<h5>Primary Activities</h5>
<p>Here's an example of one of these unique types of activities. Each lesson has 2-3 of these. 
Some activities have a section called <strong>Are you ready for more?</strong> This section, meant to expand your thinking, is optional unless otherwise stated by your teacher (Image 3).</p>

<p>After you have finished the activity, you will do a multiple choice question called a <strong>Self Check</strong> (Image 3). If you feel confident in your skills, you may move on to the next lesson.</p>
<h6>Additional Resources</h6>
<p>If you want a refresher on the skills tested in the Self Check, read through the <strong>Additional Resources</strong> section, then complete the <strong>Try It</strong> section to test yourself on what you’ve learned. This section is optional unless otherwise stated by your teacher (Image 4).</p>
